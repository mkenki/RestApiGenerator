# Project Overview: RestApiGenerator

The `RestApiGenerator` project provides a robust and flexible solution for generating REST API client code from Swagger/OpenAPI specifications. It is designed to be easily extensible and integrable into various development workflows, streamlining the process of consuming RESTful APIs in your applications.

## Key Features:

*   **Swagger/OpenAPI Specification Parsing**: Capable of parsing both JSON and YAML formats of Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.
*   **Language-Agnostic Code Model Generation**: Converts complex API schemas into a structured, language-agnostic code model, making it easy to generate code in multiple programming languages.
*   **C# Client Code Generation**: Currently offers full support for generating clean, efficient, and maintainable C# client code.
*   **Extensibility**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for custom code generation logic and seamless plugin integration to meet specific project requirements.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Provides a user-friendly command-line tool for quick code generation and integration into automated build processes.

## Project Structure:

The project is composed of two main components:

1.  **RestApiGenerator.Core**: The core library containing the fundamental logic for parsing, converting, and generating API client code.
2.  **RestApiGenerator.CLI**: A command-line interface that leverages the core library for easy interaction and automation.

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and contributing to the `RestApiGenerator` project.
